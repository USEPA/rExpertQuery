\arguments{
\item{api_key}{Character string. Users must supply their unique api key to access Expert
Query web services. To obtain an api, submit the form at:
https://owapps.epa.gov/expertquery/api-key-signup}

\item{act_agency}{Character string. Denotes the agency that is establishing/issuing the action
associated with an Assessment. Options are "state", "tribe", or "epa". Default = NULL.}

\item{act_id}{Character string. Unique Identifier for the Action associated with an Assessment
that will be used to track the Action entered (such as the corresponding information and
associated documents) in ATTAINS, and its associated name. Default = NULL.}

\item{act_name}{Character string. Unique identifier for the Action that will be used to track
the Action entered (such as the corresponding information and associated documents) in ATTAINs,
and its associated name (name of TMDL Report, 4B Report, Alternative Report, etc.). Default =
NULL.}

\item{au_name}{Character string. The name assigned to an Assessment Unit by the Organization.
Default = NULL.}

\item{auid}{Character string. A unique identifier assigned to an Assessment Unit by the
Organization. Default = NULL.}

\item{comp_date_end}{Character string. The ending date of the date range during which the
Action is planned to be completed. Usually this refers to the date that the TMDL Action date is
initially submitted to EPA. Format is "YYYY-MM-DD". Default = NULL.}

\item{comp_date_start}{Character string. The starting date of the date range during which the
Action is planned to be completed. Usually this refers to the date that the TMDL Action date is
initially submitted to EPA. Format is "YYYY-MM-DD". Default = NULL.}

\item{fisc_year_end}{Character string. The ending year for the date range of fiscal years in
which a particular action, program, or project was initiated or established. Format is "YYYY".
Default = NULL.}

\item{fisc_year_start}{Character string. The starting year for the date range of fiscal years
in which a particular action, program, or project was initiated or established. Format is "YYYY".
Default = NULL.}

\item{in_meas}{Character string. EPA can determine whether the Action should count towards 303(d)
measures. Draft Actions get partial credit and finalized Actions get full cred. By default, all
measures count towards the measures unless EPA changes this flag for a specific action. Options
are "Yes" or "No". Default = NULL.}

\item{indian_country}{Character string. Indicates if the water is either wholly or partially in
Indian country. Options are "Yes" or "No". Default = NULL.}

\item{org_id}{Character string. A unique identifier assigned to the Organization. Options can
be viewed with EQ_DomainValues("org_id"). Default = NULL.}

\item{org_name}{Character string. A unique name assigned to the Organization. Options can
be viewed with EQ_DomainValues("org_name"). Default = NULL.}

\item{region}{Numeric (integer). Integer from 1 to 10 to identify the EPA region of interest.
See https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/regional-and-geographic-offices for options. Default = NULL.}

\item{statecode}{Character string. FIPS state alpha code that identifies a state (e.g.
statecode = "DE" for Delaware). See https://www.waterqualitydata.us/Codes/statecode for options.
Default = NULL.}

\item{tmdl_date_end}{Character string. This should correspond to the ending date of the date
range that EPA approved the official final TMDL submitted (such as the date on the approval
letter). Format is "YYYY-MM-DD". Default = NULL.}

\item{tmdl_date_start}{Character string. This should correspond to the starting date of the date
range that EPA approved the official final TMDL submitted (such as the date on the approval
letter). Format is "YYYY-MM-DD". Default = NULL.}

\item{water_type}{Character string. An Assessment Unit must have at least one water type, and it
may have multiple water types. Options can be viewed with EQ_DomainValues("water_type"). Default
= NULL.}

\item{ad_param}{Character string. In the context of a TMDL, Addressed Parameters refer to
associated parameters (parameters identified as causes of impairment in the Section 303(d) list
or later identified as such through the TMDL process) that are being addressed by the pollutant
TMDL. Options can be viewed with EQ_DomainValues("ad_param"). Default = NULL.}

\item{ad_param_group}{Character string. Groups of Addressed Parameters. Options can be viewed
with EQ_DomainValues("ad_param_group").Default = NULL.}

\item{mos_exp}{Character string. Refers to the Explicit Margin of Safety for the Associated
Pollutant as identified in the TMDL. Options can be viewed with EQ_DomainValues("mos_exp").
Default = NULL.}

Pollutant as identified in the TMDL. Options can be viewed with EQ_DomainValues("mos_imp").
Default = NULL.}

\item{npdes_id}{Character string. Identification numbers of the NPDES permits within the
waterbody and are associated to a TMDL pollutant. Default = NULL.}

\item{other_id}{Character string. Alternative code identifying the TMDL Report (an example could
be a state assigned identifier that is different from the ID in the Action ID). Default = NULL.}

\item{pollutant}{Character string. Indicates the Pollutant for which the TMDL load was
calculated. Options can be viewed with EQ_DomainValues("pollutant"). Default = NULL.}

\item{poll_group}{Character string. Indicates the group the Pollutant belongs to. Options can
be viewed with EQ_DomainValues("poll_group"). Default = NULL.}
